# Introduction to a programming language
Here you will learn about a programming language ( What they are ?, Why are they necessary ?, Some examples of programming languages and the types of programming language.)
<hr>

### What is a programming language ?

A programming language is a set of instructions written in form of strings to the computer.

<hr>

### Why a programming language ?

A computer cannot simply understand instructions such as `subtract 5 from 8` or `add 100 and 2`. 

So a programming language converts the strings into a computer readable form and executes them.

## Hello World program in a few languages :
You can find more <a href="https://github.com/oliiiiiiiiiiiii/Code-bin/tree/main/hello%20world">here </a>
=== "C"

    ``` c
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void) {
      printf("Hello world!\n");
      return 0;
    }
    ```

=== "C++"

    ``` c++
    #include <iostream>

    int main(void) {
      std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
      return 0;
    }
    ```
=== "Javascript / Typescript"

    ``` js
    console.log("Hello World")
    ```
=== "Python"

    ``` py
    print("Hello World")
    ```

## COMMENTS

A comment is used to explain a part of the program to the user.
It is generally ignored by compilers and interpreters.

=== "C / C++ / Java / Go / Rust / PHP / Kotlin / JS / TS"

    ```
    // This is a single line comment
    /* This is slightly long
    multi line comment*/
    ```

=== "Ruby"

    ```
    #single line comment in Ruby

    =begin 
    This is slightly long
    multi line comment in Ruby
    =end
    ```
=== "Haskell"

    ```
    – – single line comment in Haskell

    {- longer comment :
    multi line comment in Haskell -}
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```
    #hello comment 1 in python
    #comment 2 in python
    ```
