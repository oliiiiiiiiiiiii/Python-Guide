Python is a `object oriented`, `functional`, `structured`, `reflective`, `dynamic typed`, `high-level`, `interpreted`, `general purpose` language created back in 1994 by Guido Van Rossum.

Python is written in the `C programming language`, that is why it is known as `Cpython` however there are other distros of python.

Examples : `ipython`, `jpython` etc, we are mainly going to be talking about `Cpython` in this guide.

Python based on usage index is a very popular language, it is second most used after javascript and it maybe the most learned language as it has a <i>very easy syntax</i> (one of the easiest as compared to other languages). 

Python has wide application in `web development`, `AI`, `machine learning`, `operating systems`, `mobile application development`, `data science` and `game development` etc.
