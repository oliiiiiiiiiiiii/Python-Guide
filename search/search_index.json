What is a programming language ? A programming language is a set of instructions written in form of strings to the computer. Why a programming language ? A computer cannot simply understand instructions such as subtract 5 from 8 or add 100 and 2 . So a programming language converts the strings into a computer readable form and executes them. Types of programming languages Procedural Programming Language Functional Programming Language Scripting Programming Language Logic Programming Language Object-Oriented Programming Language Examples of programming languages Some examples of programming language are : Python, Javascript, C, C++, Java, Rust, Ruby, Typescript etc.","title":"Programming Language"},{"location":"programming_language/#introduction-to-a-programming-language","text":"Here you will learn about a programming language ( What they are ?, Why are they necessary ?, Some examples of programming languages and the types of programming language.)","title":"Introduction to a programming language"},{"location":"programming_language/#what-is-a-programming-language","text":"A programming language is a set of instructions written in form of strings to the computer.","title":"What is a programming language ?"},{"location":"programming_language/#why-a-programming-language","text":"A computer cannot simply understand instructions such as subtract 5 from 8 or add 100 and 2 .

Python is written in the C programming language , that is why it is known as Cpython however there are other distros of python. Examples : ipython , jpython etc, we are mainly going to be talking about Cpython in this guide. Python based on usage index is a very popular language, it is second most used after javascript and it maybe the most learned language as it has a very easy syntax (one of the easiest as compared to other languages). Python has wide application in web development , AI , machine learning , operating systems , mobile application development , data science and game development etc.","title":"Introduction to python"}]}
